# Complex Networks Final Project

This is the working repository for codes used in the Final Project of *EE4389 : Modeling and Data Analysis in Complex Networks* course of [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl). The course is scheduled in Q3 of academic year 2017/18.

Datasets are splitted into 3 time periods:
1st Gen: Tuesday, September 29, 2009 2:56:28 AM - Monday, November 21, 2011 1:44:28 PM (GMT)  
2nd Gen: Monday, November 21, 2011 1:44:29 PM - Monday, January 13, 2014 12:32:28 AM (GMT) 
3rd Gen: Monday, January 13, 2014 12:32:29 AM - Sunday, March 6, 2016 11:05:55 AM (GMT)

*or the equivalence in epoch notation,*

1st Gen: 1254192988 - 1321883068
2nd Gen: 1321883069 - 1389573148
3rd Gen: 1389573149 - 1457262355

To run it, do the following:

1. Generate CSV files by running the `explore_metrics.py`.
2. See the various coefficient using Rstudio by running the `calculate_correlation.R`.
3. Enjoy!
